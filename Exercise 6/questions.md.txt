1. Explore "iris" data set

Load the classical "iris" data set

In R: data(iris)

In Python:
See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics-of-pandas-using-iris-dataset/

Plot the Sepal length (on X axis) vs. Sepal width (on Y axis)

Create scatter plots for all feature pairs (4 x 4)


2. Create PCA plot

Perform PCA for this data 

Visualize data on the principal components 1-2

Highlight the flower species by color for each sample

Are the species distinct 


3. PCA loadings

Retrieve loadings for the PCA components

What are the most important features for component 1?

What are the most important features for component 2?


4. PCA scores

Calculate correlations between the original data features (axes)

Calculate correlations between the PCA features (axes)

Which features are the most correlated in each case?


5. Clustering

Cluster the samples into 3 clusters

Visualize the clusters on top of PCA

Compare with the known species per each sample

Does the unsupervised clustering correspond to the known species?
